    "# Predicting 30-Day Hospital Readmission Risk\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Note:**  \n",
    "This submission follows the original capstone pitch to predict 30-day hospital readmission risk. The initial plan considered integrating the CMS Hospital Compare dataset, but this implementation uses only the open-access [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes) due to accessibility and compatibility constraints. Hospital Compare remains a target for future work and added contextual analysis, but all modeling and evaluation below reflect the Kaggle dataset.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction and Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospital readmissions within 30 days drive up costs and trigger CMS penalties. Predicting high-risk patients allows for early intervention, helps care teams prioritize outreach, and supports business objectives: reducing readmission rates, optimizing resources, and demonstrating measurable impact to hospital leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business objectives:**\n",
    "- Reduce 30-day readmission rate by at least 10%\n",
    "- Empower care teams with patient-level risk scores\n",
    "- Demonstrate business impact via cost/satisfaction improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**  \n",
    "Source: [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes)  \n",
    "Records: ~100,000 hospital encounters with patient demographic and clinical features.\n"
